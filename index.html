    <P>Broad City follows Ilana and Abbi, two Jewish American women in their twenties, who experience adventures of carelessness and frivolity in New York City. Ilana seeks to avoid working as much as possible while pursuing her relentless hedonism, and Abbi tries to make a career as an illustrator, often getting sidetracked into Ilana's schemes. <em>source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_City">wikipedia</a></em></P>
